## How to use it?

1) run: python3 final_version.py

... that's it. 

2) The program will ask you to input your balance

        How much money do you have? 1000

3) play with it!  

        What do you want to do (add / view / delete / view categories / find / exit)?

Note: "add," "find," and "delete" requires some parameters.

    For example:  add meal 2500
                  delete meal
                  find meal
                  
Thanks
